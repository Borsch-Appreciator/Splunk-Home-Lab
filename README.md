A Home lab to test out splunk as well as penetration testing and SPL queries.
This is my first time writing a blog/tracking my progress in the public eye so depending on when someone sees this, either it will be my rough draft or something that is somewhat resembling a proper project.

The overall goal for this homelab will be the installation of Splunk on an old PC and using that to monitor the logs sent from universal forwarders that I have staged on a few VM's. Throughout this project I plan on attempting numerous attacks on my Victim machine and gathering, monitoring, and setting alerts on Splunk to gain more experience with the SIEM.

First steps:
The first thing I'm doing for this home lab is starting from scratch. I have an old PC that I completely wiped and installed ubuntu server on. Once I installed the new OS I hit it with the trusty "sudo apt update-y && sudo apt upgrade -y"
